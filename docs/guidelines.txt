SAMPLE GUIDELINES

Below are six examples of the guidelines that MUST be enforced when proofreading. 

1. Q. and A. (with periods) should be used with a TAB before and after and wrap to the left margin.
For example:

	Q.	Good morning.  How are you doing today?
	A.	I'm doing well.  How about yourself?
	Q.	Good.  Thank you for asking.  As you heard, my name is Raymond Reddington.  I'm an attorney.  I work at Raymond Reddington, PLLC.  I'll be taking your deposition today.  Can I get you to start off just by stating your full and complete legal name for the record?
	A.	Yes.  My name is Amber Hard.  H-A-R-D.
	Q.	And for purposes of today, may I call you Amber?  Or do you prefer Ms. Hard?  Let me know your preference.
	A.	Amber is fine.
	Q.	And Amber, have you given a deposition before?
	A.	Yes.


2. Colloquy should have two tabs prior to each speaker ID, followed by a colon, and then 2 spaces. The text should wrap to the left margin.
For example:

		MS. KEEN:  Well, given that, I have no further questions.
		THE REPORTER:  Mr. Reddington, do you have any questions?
		MR. REDDINGTON:  I do not.  I do not have any questions.
		THE REPORTER:  Okay.  So this is the court reporter speaking.  Ms. Keen, would you like to order a copy of the transcript?
		MS. KEEN:  No, I'll just have to ask her if she wants to read or waive.
		THE WITNESS:  I'll read.
		MS. KEEN:  The witness likes to read.


3. By Lines should be included at the beginning of examinations and when you break from Colloquy back into Q/A. They indicate who the Q belongs to. 
They MUST end with a colon, left aligned, and start at the margin.

For example:

		THE REPORTER:  Okay.  The time is 10:32 a.m., and we are off the record.
		(Off the record.)
		THE REPORTER:  We are back on the record.  The time is 10:38 a.m.
BY MR. REDDINGTON:
	Q.	Amber, you mentioned a casual encounter at the local caf√© with Mr. Doe.  Can you recall the date and time of this incident?
	A.	I believe it was on the evening of July 15th, but I can't recall the exact time.


4. Parentheticals should be on a line by themselves, preceded by two tabs.

For example:

        THE REPORTER:  The time is 11:02 a.m., and we are off the record.
        (Off the record.)
        THE REPORTER: We are back on the record. The time is 11:05 a.m. 


5. Use double spaces after sentence-ending punctuation

For example:

	Q.	My name is Raymond Reddington.  May I call you Amber?  Or do you prefer Ms. Hard?  Let me know your preference.


6. When an attorney says, "Strike that," the statement that follows MUST start on a new line.

For example:

	Q.	Let's turn our attention to the events leading up to this deposition.  Did you -- strike that.  
		Were you acquainted with the plaintiff, John Doe, II, before the incident in question?
	A.	Yes, I knew John Doe.  We were acquaintances.
