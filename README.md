# PyCheck

## Introduction

This is PyCheck! A legal transcript auto-formatter and checklist, inspired by [_Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Motivation

I have been proofreading legal transcripts manually (~500 pages weekly on average), following specific guidelines. The development of this tool aims to achieve the following:

* **Accuracy**: Ensure all formatting guidelines are applied correctly, such as adding a colon and two spaces after all speaker IDs in Colloquy and a tab after all Q&As.

* **Consistency**: Common words like `videoconference` should be spelled as such throughout the document.

* **One-Click functionality**: Merge and format the document(s) in one click.

* **Ease & Speed**: Simplify the time-consuming and tedious process of manual formatting, reducing it to mere _seconds_.

The use of `PyCheck` has improved my review scores to 100%.
